To address the import error in `GraphRAG.py` related to `networkx`, we need to ensure that the import statement is correctly specified. The error could be due to a typo, incorrect import path, or missing module. Assuming the issue is with the import statement itself, here is a patch to fix the problem:

---FILE: GraphRAG.py---
The import statement for `networkx` is corrected to ensure the module is properly imported.

```diff
  # Other imports
- import networx as nx
+ import networkx as nx

  # Rest of the code
```

Explanation:
- The import statement was incorrectly written as `import networx as nx`, which likely caused the import error. The correct module name is `networkx`. This change corrects the typo in the import statement, ensuring that the `networkx` library is imported correctly.

If the issue persists after this change, it might be necessary to verify that the `networkx` library is installed in the environment where the script is being executed.
