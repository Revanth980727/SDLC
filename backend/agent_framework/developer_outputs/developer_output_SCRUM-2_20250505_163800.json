The content suggests there might be an issue with the function call syntax or structure. The current syntax seems incorrect due to the indentation and the presence of a `+` sign, which is not valid Python syntax. Here's a proposed patch to correct the syntax:\n\n---FILE: GraphRAG.py---\nThe change corrects the syntax of the function call by removing the incorrect `+` sign and fixing the indentation.\n\n```diff\n- correct_function_call()\n+ correct_function_call()\n```\n\nIf this does not resolve the issue, additional context about the function's expected behavior or any error messages would be helpful to further diagnose the problem.",
