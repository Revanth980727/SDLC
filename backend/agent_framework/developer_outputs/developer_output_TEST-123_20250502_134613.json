  "raw_gpt_response": "Given the provided code and instructions, it seems the error messages or specific issues were not detailed. However, by reviewing the code, I can identify a few syntax and import errors that need correction for the script to run properly. Since the exact repository structure was not provided, I'll assume a common project structure for Python projects and adjust the file path accordingly. \n\n### Common Python Project Structure Assumption:\nAssuming the project structure is something like this:\n```\n/project_root/\n    /your_project/\n        GraphRAG.py\n```\nI'll proceed with the fixes based on this structure.\n\n### Fixes:\n\n#### 1. Correct Import Statements\nThe import statements for `streamlit` and `networkx` are incorrect. They should use the `import` keyword.\n\n---FILE: /project_root/your_project/GraphRAG.py---\nFixing import statements for `streamlit` and `networkx`.\n\n```diff\n- streamlit as st\n+ import streamlit as st\n- networkx as nx\n+ import networkx as nx\n```\n\n#### 2. Database Credentials\nThe `DATABASE_URL` is defined but then individual DB credentials (`DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`) are also declared and used. This is redundant and could lead to confusion. However, without a specific error related to this, I'll not propose a code change but recommend reviewing the necessity of these variables.\n\n#### 3. Error Handling in SQL Execution\nThe `execute_sql_query` function catches exceptions and returns them as strings. This is generally fine for debugging but consider logging errors or handling them more gracefully in a production environment.\n\n#### Explanation:\n- **Import Statements**: Python modules should be imported using the `import` keyword. The original code missed this, which would lead to a `SyntaxError`.\n- **Database Credentials**: Highlighted as a point of potential confusion, but no change proposed without further context.\n- **Error Handling**: A suggestion rather than a fix, as returning errors as strings might not be the best practice for all use cases.\n\nThese changes address syntax issues that would prevent the script from running. Without specific error messages or descriptions of the problem, it's challenging to provide more targeted fixes. If there are runtime errors or logic issues within the code, please provide additional details for further assistance.",
