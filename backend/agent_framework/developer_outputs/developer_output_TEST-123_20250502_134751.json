  "raw_gpt_response": "Given the provided code snippet and instructions, there are several issues identified in the `GraphRAG.py` file that need fixing. However, without specific error messages or a detailed description of the bug(s) encountered, I'll address the most apparent issues based on the provided code. Since the actual repository structure was not provided, I will use a generic path based on typical Python project structures.\n\n### Issue 1: Incorrect Import Statements\n\nThe import statements for `streamlit`, `networkx`, and potentially other libraries are incorrectly formatted. They should use the `import` keyword.\n\n---FILE: /path/to/project/GraphRAG.py---\nFixing import statements for `streamlit` and `networkx`.\n\n```diff\n- streamlit as st\n+ import streamlit as st\n- networkx as nx\n+ import networkx as nx\n```\n\n### Issue 2: Database Credentials Not Set\n\nThe database credentials are initialized as empty strings, which will cause connection issues.\n\n---FILE: /path/to/project/GraphRAG.py---\nSetting placeholder values for database credentials. You should replace these with actual credentials.\n\n```diff\nDB_USER = ''\nDB_PASSWORD = ''\nDB_NAME = ''\n+ DB_USER = 'your_username'\n+ DB_PASSWORD = 'your_password'\n+ DB_NAME = 'your_database_name'\n```\n\nNote: It's not secure to hardcode credentials in your code. Consider using environment variables or a secure vault for storing sensitive information.\n\n### Issue 3: Missing Import for `sqlalchemy.text`\n\nThe `text` function is used without being properly imported from `sqlalchemy`.\n\n---FILE: /path/to/project/GraphRAG.py---\nEnsure `text` is imported correctly from `sqlalchemy`.\n\n```diff\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData, text\n```\n\nThis line is correct as is, but it's crucial to ensure that the import statement for `text` is not mistakenly removed or altered.\n\n### General Note:\n\nWithout specific error messages or a clear description of the bug(s) encountered, these fixes address syntax and potential configuration issues. If there are runtime errors or logic bugs in the code, please provide detailed error messages or descriptions for more targeted assistance. Additionally, the paths provided are placeholders; you'll need to adjust them according to your project's actual directory structure.",
