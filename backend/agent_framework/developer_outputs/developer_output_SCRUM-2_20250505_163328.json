The file `GraphRAG.py` contains a function call `intended_function_call()` that seems to be incorrect or causing an issue, and it should be replaced with `correct_function_call()`. Below is the patch to fix this issue:\n\n---FILE: GraphRAG.py---\nReplace the incorrect function call `intended_function_call()` with the correct one `correct_function_call()`.\n\n```diff\n- intended_function_call()\n+ correct_function_call()\n```\n\nThis change assumes that the function `intended_function_call()` was mistakenly used and should be replaced with `correct_function_call()`. If further context is needed, such as the specific functionality of these functions or the expected behavior, please provide additional details.",
