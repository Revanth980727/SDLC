  "raw_gpt_response": "To address the issue in the `GraphRAG.py` file, we need more context about the function `correct_function_call()`. However, since the bug description and root cause analysis are unknown, we can only make assumptions based on the provided snippet. \n\nAssuming that the function `correct_function_call()` is incorrectly named or not defined, a possible fix could be to replace it with a correctly defined or intended function. Without additional context, this is speculative, but here's an example of how you might correct a function call:\n\n---FILE: GraphRAG.py---\nAssuming `correct_function_call()` is a placeholder or incorrect function name, replace it with `intended_function_call()`.\n\n```diff\n    + intended_function_call()\n```\n\nIf `correct_function_call()` is indeed the correct function, then the issue might lie elsewhere, and more information would be needed to provide an accurate fix. Please provide additional details such as error messages, logs, or a description of the expected behavior versus the actual behavior.",
