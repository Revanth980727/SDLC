  "raw_gpt_response": "Without specific details about the bug in `GraphRAG.py`, such as the nature of the bug (e.g., runtime error, logic error, performance issue), the expected versus actual behavior, or even a snippet of the problematic code, it's challenging to provide an accurate and helpful solution. \n\nHowever, I can guide you through a general approach to debugging a Python file like `GraphRAG.py`, which might involve common issues such as syntax errors, logical errors, or issues with data handling.\n\n### General Debugging Steps:\n\n1. **Syntax Errors**: Ensure the file has no syntax errors. Python will typically point these out clearly when you try to run the script.\n2. **Logical Errors**: If the script runs but doesn't produce the expected outcome, add print statements or use a debugger to inspect variable values at critical points in the code.\n3. **Performance Issues**: If the script is slow, consider profiling the code to identify bottlenecks. Tools like `cProfile` can be helpful.\n\n### Example Fix for a Hypothetical Bug:\n\nLet's assume the bug in `GraphRAG.py` is a common one, such as attempting to access a key in a dictionary that might not exist, leading to a `KeyError`.\n\n---FILE: /path/to/GraphRAG.py---\nFixing a potential KeyError when accessing a dictionary without checking if the key exists.\n\n```diff\n- value = my_dict['key']\n+ value = my_dict.get('key', default_value)\n```\n\nThis change uses the `.get()` method of dictionaries, which allows you to specify a default value if the key does not exist, preventing a `KeyError`.\n\nWithout more details, this is a general approach to debugging. If you can provide specifics about the bug, including error messages, descriptions of incorrect behavior, or code snippets from `GraphRAG.py`, I could offer a more targeted solution.",
