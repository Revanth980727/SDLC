  "raw_gpt_response": "To address the import error related to `networkx` in `GraphRAG.py`, we need to ensure that the import statements are correctly specified. The issue might be due to incorrect module paths or missing imports. Below is the patch to fix the import issue:\n\n---FILE: GraphRAG.py---\nExplanation: Corrected the import statement for `networkx` to ensure the module is properly imported. This change assumes that the error was due to an incorrect or missing import statement.\n\n```diff\n- import networkx as nx\n+ import networkx\n```\n\nIf the above change does not resolve the issue, it might be necessary to provide more context or details about the specific error message being encountered. This could include the exact error message or stack trace to further diagnose the problem.",
