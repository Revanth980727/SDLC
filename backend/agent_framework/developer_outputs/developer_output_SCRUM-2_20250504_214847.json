The correct syntax should be used to properly import the library.\n\n```diff\n- import networkx as nx\n+ import networkx\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The original import statement `import networkx as nx` is incorrect if the code later refers to `networkx` directly instead of `nx`. The simplest fix is to change the import statement to `import networkx`, assuming the rest of the code uses the full module name `networkx` instead of the alias `nx`. If the code uses `nx`, then the import statement is correct, and the issue lies elsewhere in the code.",
