  "raw_gpt_response": "To address the issue described in Ticket ID: SCRUM-2, we need more information to identify the bug and its root cause. However, since the file `GraphRAG.py` is missing and cannot be read, the first step is to ensure that the file exists in the expected directory. Here are some steps and potential changes that could be made once the file is accessible:\n\n1. **Verify File Existence**: Ensure that `GraphRAG.py` is present in the `/app/code_repo/` directory. If it is missing, retrieve it from version control or a backup.\n\n2. **Check for Common Issues**: Once the file is accessible, check for common issues such as syntax errors, import errors, or logical errors that could cause the application to malfunction.\n\n3. **Logging and Debugging**: Add logging statements to capture more information about the application's state and identify where the issue might be occurring.\n\n4. **Patch Example**: If a specific bug is identified, a patch can be created. Below is a hypothetical example of a patch that might be applied if a common issue is found:\n\n   ---FILE: /app/code_repo/GraphRAG.py---\n   Assume a missing import statement is causing a NameError.\n\n   ```diff\n   # Example of adding a missing import statement\n   + import necessary_module\n\n   # Example of fixing a logical error\n   - result = calculate_value(x, y)\n   + result = calculate_value(x, y, z)\n   ```\n\n5. **Request More Information**: If the above steps do not resolve the issue, additional information is needed. Specifically:\n   - A detailed description of the bug's symptoms.\n   - Any error messages or logs that are generated.\n   - The expected behavior versus the actual behavior.\n   - Steps to reproduce the issue.\n\nOnce the file is accessible and more information is available, a more targeted fix can be implemented.",
