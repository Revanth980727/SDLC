  "raw_gpt_response": "Given the provided code snippet and the instructions, it appears that the error messages were not explicitly mentioned, which makes it challenging to identify the exact issue without more context. However, I can spot a few potential problems in the code that could lead to errors. I'll address these issues based on common Python and Streamlit practices, along with potential SQLAlchemy and Plotly integration mistakes.\n\n### Issue 1: Incorrect Import Statements\n\nThe import statements for `streamlit` and `networkx` are incorrect. They lack the `import` keyword, which would cause a `SyntaxError`.\n\n---FILE: /path/to/GraphRAG.py---\nFixing incorrect import statements for `streamlit` and `networkx`.\n\n```diff\n- streamlit as st\n+ import streamlit as st\n-  networkx as nx\n+ import networkx as nx\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nPython requires the `import` keyword to import modules. The original code mistakenly omits this keyword, which would lead to a `SyntaxError` upon execution.\n\n### Issue 2: Database Credentials Not Set\n\nThe database credentials (`DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`) are empty strings. While not a syntax error, this would lead to a runtime error when attempting to connect to the database.\n\n---FILE: /path/to/GraphRAG.py---\nPlaceholder for setting database credentials.\n\n```diff\nDB_USER = ''\nDB_PASSWORD = ''\nDB_NAME = ''\n+ DB_USER = 'your_username'\n+ DB_PASSWORD = 'your_password'\n+ DB_NAME = 'your_database_name'\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\nFor the script to connect to the database, valid credentials must be provided. The placeholders should be replaced with actual credentials. Note that hardcoding credentials in source code is not a best practice for production environments; consider using environment variables or secure vaults for storing sensitive information.\n\n### General Note:\n\nWithout explicit error messages or a description of the encountered issue, the provided fixes are based on common errors inferred from the code. If there are specific runtime errors or exceptions being thrown, please provide those details for a more targeted solution. Additionally, ensure that all required libraries (`streamlit`, `sqlalchemy`, `networkx`, `plotly`, `pandas`, `mysql-connector-python`, etc.) are installed in your environment.",
