  "raw_gpt_response": "To provide an accurate and helpful response, I would need specific details about the bug you're encountering. The information provided in the ticket (TEST-123) lacks the necessary details to identify the problem and propose a solution. Specifically, I would need to know:\n\n1. **Description of the Bug**: A clear and concise description of what the bug is, including any error messages or incorrect behavior observed.\n2. **Affected Files, Modules/Components, Functions/Classes**: Knowing which parts of the software are affected is crucial for pinpointing where the bug might be and proposing a fix.\n3. **Steps to Reproduce**: A step-by-step guide on how to reproduce the issue can be very helpful in understanding the bug's context and its impact.\n4. **Expected vs. Actual Behavior**: What the software is supposed to do in the scenario where the bug occurs versus what it actually does.\n5. **Environment Details**: Information about the operating system, software version, and any relevant hardware or external dependencies that might influence the bug.\n\nWithout this information, it's challenging to provide a specific code fix. However, I can offer a general approach to debugging that might help you narrow down the issue:\n\n1. **Review Logs**: Check application and system logs around the time the bug was observed for any errors or warnings that might give clues.\n2. **Debugging Tools**: Use debugging tools available for your development environment to step through the affected parts of the code and observe where the behavior diverges from the expected.\n3. **Unit Tests**: If your project has unit tests, run them to see if any related tests fail. This can also help pinpoint the issue.\n4. **Code Review**: Sometimes, bugs can be spotted by reviewing the code with fresh eyes or asking a colleague to review it. Look for common issues like off-by-one errors, uninitialized variables, or incorrect logic conditions.\n\nIf you can provide more specific details about the bug, I would be happy to offer a more targeted solution.",
