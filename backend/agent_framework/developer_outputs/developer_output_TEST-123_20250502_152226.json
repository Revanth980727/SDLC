  "raw_gpt_response": "To provide an accurate and helpful response, I would need specific details about the bug related to the import statements in `GraphRAG.py`. However, since the error messages and the exact issue with the import statements are not provided, I'll make an educated guess based on common issues with import statements in Python projects that use SQLAlchemy.\n\nAssuming the bug is related to the inability to connect to the database due to missing connection string setup, I will demonstrate how to fix a common issue where the database engine is not properly configured with the provided credentials.\n\nWithout the actual repository structure or more details, I'll use a placeholder path, but please replace `[your_repository_path]` with your actual repository path.\n\n---FILE: [your_repository_path]/GraphRAG.py---\nFixing the database engine creation to use the provided DB credentials.\n\n```diff\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData, text\nDB_USER = 'your_username'\nDB_PASSWORD = 'your_password'\nDB_NAME = 'your_database_name'\n+ DB_HOST = 'your_host'  # Add your database host\n+ DB_PORT = 'your_port'  # Add your database port, typically 5432 for PostgreSQL or 3306 for MySQL\n- \n+ engine = create_engine(f\"postgresql://{DB_USER}:{DB_PASSWORD}@{DB_HOST}:{DB_PORT}/{DB_NAME}\")\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- Added `DB_HOST` and `DB_PORT` variables to be used in the connection string. You need to replace `'your_host'` and `'your_port'` with your actual database host and port.\n- Created the `engine` variable using `create_engine` from SQLAlchemy, constructing the connection string with the provided database credentials and connection details. This is necessary for SQLAlchemy to interact with the database.\n- The assumption here is that you're using a PostgreSQL database given the common use with SQLAlchemy. If you're using a different database (like MySQL, SQLite, etc.), the connection string format (`\"postgresql://...\"`) needs to be adjusted accordingly (e.g., `\"mysql+pymysql://...\"` for MySQL).\n\nPlease adjust the `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, and the connection string format according to your actual database system and environment.",
