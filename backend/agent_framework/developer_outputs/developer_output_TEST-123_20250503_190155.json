  "raw_gpt_response": "To address the import error in `GraphRAG.py`, we need to ensure that the `networkx` library is correctly imported. The error might be due to an incorrect import statement or a missing import. Below is the patch to fix the import issue.\n\n---FILE: GraphRAG.py---\nThe change ensures that the `networkx` library is correctly imported as `nx`, which is the conventional alias used for this library.\n\n```diff\n- import networkx\n+ import networkx as nx\n```\n\nThis change will resolve the import error by ensuring that `networkx` is imported with the alias `nx`, allowing the rest of the code to use `nx` as expected. If there are further issues or if this does not resolve the error, additional context or error messages would be helpful to diagnose the problem further.",
