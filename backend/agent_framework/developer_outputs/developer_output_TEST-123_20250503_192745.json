  "raw_gpt_response": "To address the import error in `GraphRAG.py`, we need to ensure that the `networkx` library is correctly imported. The issue might be due to an incorrect import statement or a missing installation of the library. Assuming the library is installed, I'll provide a patch to correct the import statement.\n\n---FILE: GraphRAG.py---\nThe import statement for `networkx` is corrected to ensure proper module usage.\n\n```diff\n- import networkx as nx\n+ import networkx\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The original import statement might be causing an error due to aliasing (`as nx`). If the alias is not used elsewhere in the code, removing it can resolve the import error. If the alias is used, ensure that the alias `nx` is correctly used throughout the file.\n- If the alias `nx` is necessary, ensure that the `networkx` library is installed in your environment using `pip install networkx`.\n\nIf the alias `nx` is used in the code, and the import error persists, please provide additional details or context about the error message or the environment setup.",
