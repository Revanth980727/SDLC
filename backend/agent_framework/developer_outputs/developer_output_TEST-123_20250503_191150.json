  "raw_gpt_response": "To address the import error in `GraphRAG.py`, we need to ensure that the `networkx` library is imported correctly. The error might be due to an incorrect import statement or a missing library. Assuming the library is installed, I'll correct the import statement. Here's the patch:\n\n---FILE: GraphRAG.py---\nThe change corrects the import statement for the `networkx` library, ensuring it is imported as `nx`.\n\n```diff\n- import networkx\n+ import networkx as nx\n```\n\nThis change assumes that the rest of the code uses `nx` as the alias for `networkx`. If the code does not use `nx` as an alias, further changes might be needed to update the usage throughout the file. If the error persists, please ensure that the `networkx` library is installed in your environment.",
