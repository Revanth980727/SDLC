  "raw_gpt_response": "To address the import error in `GraphRAG.py`, we need to ensure that the `networkx` library is imported correctly. The issue might be due to an incorrect import statement or a missing import. Below is the patch to fix this issue:\n\n---FILE: GraphRAG.py---\nThe import statement for `networkx` is corrected to ensure proper module usage.\n\n```diff\n  # Existing imports\n- import networkx as nx\n+ import networkx\n\n  # Usage of networkx in the code\n  def some_function():\n      # Example usage\n-     G = nx.Graph()\n+     G = networkx.Graph()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The original import statement `import networkx as nx` was changed to `import networkx` to ensure that the module is imported correctly without aliasing.\n- The usage of `networkx` in the code was updated to use the full module name `networkx.Graph()` instead of the alias `nx.Graph()`. This ensures that the code is consistent with the new import statement.\n\nIf the issue persists or if there are other specific errors related to the import, additional context or error messages would be helpful to further diagnose the problem.",
