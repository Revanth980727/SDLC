  "raw_gpt_response": "To provide an accurate and helpful response, I would need specific details about the bug you're encountering, including:\n\n1. The programming language or technologies used in your project.\n2. A brief description of the bug, including any error messages you're receiving.\n3. The expected behavior versus the actual behavior you're observing.\n4. Any relevant snippets of code or file names where you suspect the bug might be located.\n\nWithout these details, it's challenging to offer a precise solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to debugging that might help:\n\n1. **Review the Error Message**: If your application is generating an error message, start there. Error messages often include a file path and a line number where the problem occurred.\n\n2. **Isolate the Problem**: Try to narrow down where the bug could be. This might involve commenting out sections of code to see if the error persists or writing unit tests to pinpoint the faulty behavior.\n\n3. **Check for Common Pitfalls**: Depending on the language or framework you're using, there might be common mistakes to look out for. For example, in JavaScript, a common bug is trying to access a property of `undefined`.\n\n4. **Use Debugging Tools**: Most IDEs have built-in debugging tools that allow you to step through your code, inspect variables, and see the call stack at the point where an error occurs.\n\n5. **Consult Documentation and Community**: Sometimes, the issue might be due to a misunderstanding of how a particular function or library is supposed to work. Consulting the official documentation or asking for help on forums like Stack Overflow can provide insights.\n\nIf you can provide more specific information about your bug, I'd be happy to offer a more targeted solution.",
