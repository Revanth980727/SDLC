  "raw_gpt_response": "To address the ImportError in `GraphRAG.py` related to the `networkx` library, we need to ensure that the import statement is correctly formatted. Below is the patch to fix the import error:\n\n---FILE: GraphRAG.py---\nThe import statement for `networkx` was malformed. This patch corrects the import statement to properly import the `networkx` library.\n\n```diff\n  # Import statements at the beginning of the file\n- import networkx as nx\n+ import networkx\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The original import statement `import networkx as nx` was likely causing an ImportError due to incorrect aliasing or a typo. By changing it to `import networkx`, we ensure that the module is imported correctly without aliasing, which should resolve the ImportError. If aliasing is required elsewhere in the code, it can be reintroduced with the correct syntax.",
