  "raw_gpt_response": "To address the issue described in the ticket, we need more information about the context in which `correct_function_call()` is used. However, since no additional details are provided, I'll make an assumption that the function name `correct_function_call()` might be incorrect or not defined. This is a common issue when dealing with unknown bugs in code snippets.\n\nHere's a patch that assumes the function name needs to be corrected or defined:\n\n---FILE: GraphRAG.py---\nAssuming the function name `correct_function_call()` is incorrect or undefined, we will replace it with a placeholder function `placeholder_function()` which should be defined elsewhere in the codebase or needs to be defined.\n\n```diff\n- correct_function_call()\n+ placeholder_function()\n```\n\nIf `correct_function_call()` is indeed the correct function name and the issue lies elsewhere, please provide more context or details about the expected behavior, any error messages, or logs that could help in diagnosing the problem.",
