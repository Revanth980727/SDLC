  "raw_gpt_response": "To provide an accurate and helpful response, I need specific details about the bug you're encountering. The information provided in the ticket TEST-123 is too vague to offer a direct solution. Could you please provide more details on the following:\n\n1. **Description of the Bug**: A clear and concise description of what the bug is. For example, is the application crashing? Are you seeing incorrect data? Is there a performance issue?\n\n2. **Affected Files, Modules/Components, Functions/Classes**: Even if not specified in the original ticket, any insights you have into where the problem might be occurring would be helpful. If you're unsure, describing the feature or part of the application that's not working as expected can provide a starting point.\n\n3. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps on how to reproduce the issue. This is crucial for understanding the context and environment in which the bug occurs.\n\n4. **Expected vs. Actual Behavior**: What should the application do in this scenario, and what is it actually doing?\n\n5. **Environment Details**: Information about the environment in which the bug was found, such as the operating system, version of the software, and any relevant hardware or network configurations.\n\n6. **Error Messages/Logs**: Any error messages, stack traces, or relevant excerpts from logs can provide critical clues.\n\nWithout specific details, it's challenging to offer a precise solution. However, I can provide a generic example of how to format a response once more information is available:\n\n---\n\n**Example Response Based on Hypothetical Bug:**\n\nAssuming the bug is related to a web application where users are unable to log in due to an incorrect password validation logic.\n\n---FILE: /path/to/project/src/authentication/AuthService.js---\n**Brief explanation of what's being fixed:**\nFixing the password validation logic to correctly compare the user's input with the hashed password in the database.\n\n```diff\n- if (inputPassword === storedPasswordHash) {\n+ if (bcrypt.compareSync(inputPassword, storedPasswordHash)) {\n```\n\n**Why this fixes the issue:**\nThe original line directly compared the plaintext password input by the user with the hashed password stored in the database, which would always result in a mismatch. The updated line uses bcrypt's compareSync method to correctly compare the plaintext password with the hashed password, allowing for successful authentication when the correct password is entered.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide more detailed information about the bug you're experiencing, and I'll be happy to offer a more tailored solution.",
